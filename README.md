1. Local Node.js:

    Prerequisites: You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. Check their official websites for installation instructions:
        Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en
        npm: https://www.npmjs.com/ (included with Node.js installation)
        yarn (optional alternative to npm): https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
    Running the Application:
        Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
        Install dependencies with npm install (or yarn install if using yarn).
        Start the application using nodemon (assuming it's a Node.js application):
        This will start your application in development mode, automatically restarting the server when changes are saved.

1. Running Your Application with Docker:

  Prerequisites:

    Docker and Docker Compose: Ensure you have both Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Refer to the previous guide for installation links if needed.
    docker-compose.yml File: Make sure your project has a file named docker-compose.yml. This file defines how your application runs in Docker containers. It may already exist or might need to be created based on your project's requirements.

Steps:     Open Terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to your project directory.
Build Images (Optional):
  If you haven't built the Docker images for your application before, run this command:


        docker-compose build
        or sudo docker-compose build


    This command reads your docker-compose.yml file and creates Docker images based on the specifications defined for each service (container) in your application.

    If the images already exist, you can skip this step.

Start Containers: 
Linux: The sudo prefix is required to grant necessary permissions for Docker Compose to interact with the system.
        Windows: On Windows, you don't need sudo as Docker Desktop handles permissions internally.
            Run this command to start your application's containers in detached mode (background):

       sudo docker-compose up -d


    
Verify Application:

     The application should now be running in Docker containers. The specific port it runs on might differ depending on your project setup. Check your docker-compose.yml file or project configuration.
    Example (Port 3000): The application typically runs on port 3000, you can access it in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.
